# Security Policies

Mantle uses a rule-based engine to identify secrets in your application logs and build output. These rules are called **Security Policies**.

## Built-in Protection

Mantle comes pre-configured with a curated set of high-accuracy detection patterns for common secret types:

### Supported Patterns

| Name | Description | Severity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AWS Access Key** | Standard AWS Access Key IDs (AKIA...) | `critical` |
| **GitHub Tokens** | Classic, OAuth, and Fine-grained Personal Access Tokens | `critical` |
| **Stripe Keys** | Live and Test Secret Keys | `critical` / `high` |
| **Google API Key** | Google Cloud Platform API keys | `critical` |
| **Private Keys** | RSA, EC, and SSH private key blocks | `critical` |
| **Azure Connection String** | Azure Storage account keys | `critical` |
| **OpenAI API Key** | OpenAI API keys (sk-...) | `critical` |
| **NPM Token** | NPM access tokens | `critical` |
| **GitLab Personal Token** | GitLab Personal Access Tokens (glpat-...) | `critical` |
| **PyPI API Token** | Python Package Index API tokens | `critical` |
| **JWT Tokens** | JSON Web Tokens (base64 encoded) | `high` |
| **Slack Webhooks** | Incoming Webhook URLs | `high` |
| **Twilio Auth Token** | Twilio authentication tokens | `high` |
| **SendGrid Keys** | SendGrid API credentials | `medium` |
| **Generic Detectors** | Broad patterns for `api_key`, `secret`, and `password` | `medium` |

## Dynamic Detection

In addition to pattern-based detection, Mantle also performs:

- **Exact value matching**: Any secret loaded from your providers is matched exactly
- **High-entropy detection**: Identifies strings that look like secrets based on character distribution
- **Assignment pattern detection**: Catches patterns like `password=` or `api_key:` in output

## Priority and Merging

If a value matches multiple patterns, Mantle:
1. Merges overlapping redaction ranges
2. Reports the pattern with the highest severity

This ensures comprehensive protection without redundant alerts.
