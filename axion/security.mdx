# Security

Axion employs a **client-side zero-knowledge architecture** with industry-standard cryptography.

## Encryption

| Component | Implementation |
|:----------|:---------------|
| **Encryption** | AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption) |
| **Key Derivation** | Argon2id (64 MiB memory, 3 iterations, 4 parallelism) |
| **Project Key** | 128-bit random key |
| **Salt** | 256-bit random salt per encryption |
| **IV** | 128-bit random IV per encryption |
| **Format** | Versioned for future algorithm upgrades |

## How It Works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant CLI as Axion CLI
    participant Cloud as Axion Cloud

    Dev->>CLI: axn set API_KEY "sk-xxx"
    CLI->>CLI: Encrypt with local key
    CLI->>Cloud: Send encrypted blob
    Note over Cloud: Cannot decrypt<br/>Zero-knowledge

    Dev->>CLI: axn run -- npm start
    CLI->>Cloud: Fetch encrypted blob
    CLI->>CLI: Decrypt with local key
    CLI->>Dev: Inject into process.env
```

## Key Management (Zero-Disk Auth)

Axion uses a **Zero-Disk Authentication** model for enhanced security.

-   **Development**: Keys are fetched dynamically from the server when you run `dotset login`.
-   **Memory-Only**: Keys are injected directly into process memory and never written to disk.
-   **Scope Isolation**: Each environment (Development, Staging, Production) has a unique encryption key.

<Note>
Legacy local-only projects may still use `.dotset/axion/key` for offline development, but cloud-linked projects use dynamic key fetching.
</Note>

<Warning>
This file contains your encryption key. Add it to `.gitignore` and back it up securely.
</Warning>

## Protected Keys

Configure write-only secrets in `axion.config.yaml`:

```yaml
protected_keys:
  - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
  - DATABASE_PASSWORD
```

Protected keys:
- Can be set but not revealed
- Cannot be exported
- Cannot be viewed with `--reveal`

## Validation Patterns

Enforce secret formats:

```yaml
validation:
  DATABASE_URL: "^postgres://"
  API_KEY: "^sk-[a-z0-9]{32}$"
```

## Key Rotation

Rotate your encryption key:

```bash
axn rotate
```

This:
1. Generates a new key
2. Re-encrypts all secrets
3. Invalidates the old key

## Key Recovery

Set up recovery before you need it:

```bash
# Create recovery blob
axn recovery setup

# Restore if key is lost
axn recovery restore
```

## Audit Logs

Track all secret access (Pro/Business):

```bash
axn audit
```

Shows:
- Who accessed secrets
- When and from where
- What operations were performed

## Best Practices

  <Card title="Gitignore" icon="git">
    Add `.dotset/axion/key` to `.gitignore`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Backup" icon="cloud">
    Back up your key to a password manager
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rotate" icon="rotate">
    Rotate keys periodically or after team changes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Protect" icon="lock">
    Mark sensitive keys as protected
