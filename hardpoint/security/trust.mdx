# Security & Trust

Hardpoint is designed with security as a core principle. Here's what you need to know.

## Privacy by Design

### No Network Access

Hardpoint runs entirely locally. It never:

- Phones home
- Uploads scan results
- Connects to external services
- Collects telemetry

### No Data Collection

- No usage analytics
- No crash reporting
- No feature flags
- Your code stays on your machine

### Open Source

All code is publicly auditable:

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dotsetlabs/hardpoint)
- MIT License
- Full source code access

## How Scanning Works

### Local Pattern Matching

Hardpoint uses local regex pattern matching:

1. Reads files from your filesystem
2. Matches against bundled rule definitions
3. Reports findings locally
4. No external processing

### Rule Definitions

Rules are embedded in the binary:

```yaml
# Example rule structure
- id: AI-001
  pattern: '(?i)ignore\s+(all\s+)?previous\s+instructions'
  severity: critical
```

Rules never change without a new release.

## Supply Chain Security

### Minimal Dependencies

Hardpoint has only 2 direct dependencies:

- `github.com/spf13/cobra` - CLI framework
- `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` - YAML parsing

### Reproducible Builds

Builds are reproducible and verifiable:

```bash
# Verify checksum
sha256sum hardpoint
# Compare against published checksums.txt
```

### Signed Releases

All releases include:

- SHA256 checksums
- Provenance attestation
- Signed with Sigstore

## Threat Model

### What Hardpoint Protects Against

| Threat | Protection |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Prompt injection in AI configs | Pattern detection |
| Hidden Unicode attacks | Character analysis |
| Shell backdoors | Command pattern matching |
| Credential exposure | Secret pattern + entropy detection |
| Git hook attacks | Hook content analysis |
| Service exposure | Network binding checks |

### What Hardpoint Does NOT Protect Against

| Threat | Reason |
| ------ | ------ |
| Runtime attacks | Static analysis only |
| Obfuscated malware | Pattern-based detection |
| Zero-day exploits | Known pattern matching |
| Network intrusion | Local scanning only |

## Responsible Disclosure

Found a security issue? Please report it:

- Email: security@dotsetlabs.com
- Do NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities
- We'll respond within 48 hours

See our [Security Policy](https://github.com/dotsetlabs/hardpoint/security/policy) for details.

## Compliance

Hardpoint can help with:

- **SOC 2**: Developer environment security controls
- **ISO 27001**: Secure development practices
- **PCI DSS**: Protecting cardholder data
- **HIPAA**: Preventing credential exposure

Use SARIF output for audit trail:

```bash
hardpoint scan --output sarif > scan-$(date +%Y%m%d).sarif
```

## Best Practices

1. **Run regularly** - Daily scans catch issues early
2. **Use in CI/CD** - Automate security checks
3. **Review suppressions** - Don't ignore real issues
4. **Keep updated** - New rules catch new threats
5. **Report issues** - Help improve detection
