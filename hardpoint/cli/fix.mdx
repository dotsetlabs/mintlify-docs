# hardpoint fix

Automatically fix security issues that have safe resolutions.

## Usage

```bash
hardpoint fix [path] [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be fixed without making changes |
| `-o, --output <format>` | Output format (text, json, sarif) |

## Examples

### Fix Issues in Current Directory

```bash
hardpoint fix
```

### Fix Issues in Specific Path

```bash
hardpoint fix ./project
```

### Preview Changes

```bash
hardpoint fix --dry-run
```

Output:
```
Would fix: Overly permissive git hook (./hooks/pre-commit)
  Rule: GIT-001

Dry run complete: 1 issues can be auto-fixed
Run without --dry-run to apply fixes
```

## Fixable Issues

Not all security issues can be auto-fixed. Currently fixable issues include:

| Rule | Fix Applied |
|:-----|:------------|
| GIT-001 to GIT-006 | Remove or sanitize malicious hook content |

### Non-Fixable Issues

The following issues require manual review:

- **AI-008** (Semantic Hijacking): Malicious instructions hidden in comments require human judgment
- **AI-005** (MCP Command Injection): Command injection patterns need context-aware fixes
- **AI-004** (Encoded Instructions): Encoded content requires manual inspection

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|:-----|:--------|
| 0 | All fixable issues resolved |
| 1 | Some issues could not be fixed |
