# hardpoint ignore

Add findings to an ignore list to suppress them in future scans.

## Usage

```bash
hardpoint ignore [finding-id] [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `--list` | List all ignored findings |
| `--remove <id>` | Remove finding from ignore list |
| `--reason <text>` | Reason for ignoring |

## Examples

### Ignore a Finding

```bash
hardpoint ignore abc123
```

### Ignore with Reason

```bash
hardpoint ignore abc123 --reason "False positive - internal testing file"
```

### List Ignored Findings

```bash
hardpoint ignore --list
```

Output:
```
Ignored findings (2):

  abc123
    Reason: False positive - internal testing file
    Added: 2025-01-10 14:30:00
    Path: ./test/fixtures/malicious.md

  def456
    Reason: Acknowledged risk - required for build
    Added: 2025-01-09 10:15:00
    Path: ./.git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Remove from Ignore List

```bash
hardpoint ignore --remove abc123
```

## Ignore File

Ignored findings are stored in `.hardpoint-ignore` in your project root:

```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "findingId": "abc123",
      "reason": "False positive - internal testing file",
      "addedAt": "2025-01-10T14:30:00Z",
      "path": "./test/fixtures/malicious.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always provide a reason**: Document why a finding is being ignored for future reference
2. **Review periodically**: Use `--list` to audit ignored findings
3. **Commit the ignore file**: Include `.hardpoint-ignore` in version control for team visibility
4. **Prefer fixes over ignores**: Only ignore when auto-fix isn't available and manual fix isn't practical

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|:-----|:--------|
