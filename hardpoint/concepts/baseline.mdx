# Baseline & Suppressions

Hardpoint's baseline system lets you suppress known-safe findings to reduce noise and focus on real issues.

## Configuration File

Create `.hardpoint/baseline.yaml` in your project or home directory:

```yaml
suppressions:
  - id: AI-001
    reason: Intentional override for testing

  - id: SHELL-002
    pattern: "homebrew"
    reason: Official Homebrew installer

  - id: SECRET-001
    file: "tests/*.env"
    reason: Test fixtures with fake credentials
```

## Suppression Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| `id` | Yes | Finding ID to suppress (e.g., `AI-001`) |
| `reason` | Yes | Why this finding is suppressed |
| `file` | No | Glob pattern for specific files |
| `pattern` | No | Regex to match in line content |
| `expires` | No | Expiration date (ISO 8601) |

## Matching Rules

### By Finding ID Only

Suppresses all findings with this ID:

```yaml
suppressions:
  - id: NET-001
    reason: Development server intentionally exposed
```

### By File Pattern

Only suppresses in matching files:

```yaml
suppressions:
  - id: SECRET-001
    file: "tests/**/*.env"
    reason: Test fixtures
```

Glob patterns supported:
- `*` - Match any characters except `/`
- `**` - Match any characters including `/`
- `?` - Match single character

### By Content Pattern

Only suppresses when line content matches:

```yaml
suppressions:
  - id: SHELL-002
    pattern: "brew\\.sh|homebrew"
    reason: Official package manager
```

### With Expiration

Temporary suppressions:

```yaml
suppressions:
  - id: AI-002
    reason: Temporary during migration
    expires: 2025-03-01T00:00:00Z
```

Expired suppressions are automatically ignored.

## Examples

### Suppress Test Fixtures

```yaml
suppressions:
  - id: AI-001
    file: "testdata/**"
    reason: Test fixtures for scanner validation

  - id: SECRET-001
    file: "tests/**"
    reason: Fake credentials for testing
```

### Suppress Known-Safe Patterns

```yaml
suppressions:
  - id: SHELL-002
    pattern: "nvm\\.sh|rvm|homebrew"
    reason: Official version managers and package managers
```

### Suppress During Investigation

```yaml
suppressions:
  - id: GIT-001
    file: ".git/hooks/pre-commit"
    reason: Investigating - ticket #1234
    expires: 2025-02-01T00:00:00Z
```

## CLI Commands

Hardpoint provides CLI commands to manage baselines:

```bash
# List all suppressions
hardpoint baseline list

# Add a new suppression
hardpoint baseline add AI-001 --reason "Known safe pattern"

# Remove expired suppressions
hardpoint baseline prune

# Preview what would be removed
hardpoint baseline prune --dry-run
```

See [baseline command](/hardpoint/cli/baseline) for full documentation.

## Viewing Active Suppressions

When running with `--verbose`, Hardpoint shows suppression statistics:

```bash
hardpoint scan --verbose
```

Output includes:
```
Suppressed 3 findings via baseline
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always include a reason** - Future you will thank present you
2. **Use specific patterns** - Avoid overly broad suppressions
3. **Set expiration dates** - For temporary suppressions
4. **Review periodically** - Remove stale suppressions
5. **Keep in version control** - Track changes to suppressions

[!CAUTION]
Be careful not to suppress real security issues. Only suppress findings you have verified are false positives or accepted risks.
