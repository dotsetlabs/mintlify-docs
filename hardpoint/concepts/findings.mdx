# Findings

Each issue Hardpoint detects is reported as a finding with detailed information to help you understand and remediate the issue.

## Finding Structure

```json
{
  "id": "AI-001",
  "title": "Instruction Override Detected",
  "description": "Pattern attempts to override AI safety guidelines",
  "severity": "critical",
  "confidence": "high",
  "scanner": "ai",
  "file_path": ".cursorrules",
  "line_number": 15,
  "line_content": "Ignore all previous instructions...",
  "remediation": "Remove instruction override attempts",
  "references": [
    "https://example.com/ai-security"
  ],
  "tags": ["prompt-injection", "ai-safety"]
}
```

## Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Action |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ |
| **Critical** | Immediate security risk | Fix immediately |
| **High** | Significant security concern | Fix soon |
| **Medium** | Potential security issue | Review and fix |
| **Low** | Minor security consideration | Fix when convenient |
| **Info** | Informational finding | No action required |

## Confidence Levels

| Level | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| **High** | Very likely a real issue |
| **Medium** | Probably an issue, verify |
| **Low** | Might be a false positive |

## Filtering Findings

### By Severity

```bash
# Only critical findings
hardpoint scan --severity critical

# High and above
hardpoint scan --severity high
```

### By Confidence

```bash
# Only high confidence
hardpoint scan --confidence high
```

### Combined Filters

```bash
# High severity, high confidence only
hardpoint scan --severity high --confidence high
```

## Finding IDs

Each scanner uses a prefix for its finding IDs:

| Prefix | Scanner |
| ------ | ------- |
| `AI-` | AI Configuration |
| `SHELL-` | Shell Configuration |
| `GIT-` | Git Security |
| `NET-` | Network Exposure |
| `SECRET-` | Secrets |

## Output Formats

### Terminal

Human-readable output with colors and formatting:

```
CRITICAL  AI-001: Instruction Override Detected
          File: .cursorrules:15
          Pattern attempts to override AI safety guidelines

          Remediation: Remove instruction override attempts
```

### JSON

Machine-readable for scripting:

```bash
hardpoint scan --output json | jq '.findings[] | select(.severity == "critical")'
```

### SARIF

For GitHub Code Scanning and IDE integration:

```bash
hardpoint scan --output sarif > results.sarif
```

## Remediation

Each finding includes remediation guidance. Common actions:

| Finding Type | Typical Remediation |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| Instruction Override | Remove override attempts from config |
| Hidden Unicode | Use `hardpoint fix AI-003` to strip |
| Curl Pipe Bash | Download then inspect before running |
| Exposed Service | Bind to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 |
| Hardcoded Secret | Move to environment variables |

## References

Many findings include references to:

- Security advisories
- Best practice documentation
- Attack technique descriptions

Use these to understand the risk and learn more about the threat.
