# Team Secret Sharing

Sync secrets across your team using the cloud.

## Prerequisites

1. Create an account at [app.dotsetlabs.com](https://app.dotsetlabs.com)
2. Authenticate: `dotset login`

## Push Secrets to Cloud

```bash
dotset secrets sync --push
```

This uploads your encrypted secrets to the cloud. They remain encrypted — we never see your values.

## Pull Secrets from Cloud

```bash
dotset secrets sync --pull
```

Downloads secrets from the cloud and merges with your local store.

## Workflow

### Setting Up a New Team Member

1. Clone the repository
2. Initialize native storage: `dotset secrets init`
3. Get the project key from your team (securely!)
4. Login: `dotset login`
5. Pull secrets: `dotset secrets sync --pull`

<Warning>
**Security First**: Share your project key securely (e.g., 1Password, Bitwarden). Never share it in plaintext channels like Slack or email.
</Warning>

### Updating Secrets

```bash
# Add or update secret in native storage
dotset secrets set NEW_API_KEY "..."

# Push to team
dotset secrets sync --push
```

## Why Sync Native Storage?

While Shield can pull secrets from AWS or `.env` files, **Native Storage** with Cloud Sync is the best way to manage environment-specific credentials that need to be shared across a development team without relying on external infrastructure.

### Benefits
- **Zero-Infrastructure**: No need to manage AWS IAM roles for every developer.
- **Offline Access**: Secrets are encrypted on your local machine.
- **Audit Logs**: See who updated which secret and when (Business plan).
