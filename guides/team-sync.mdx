# Team Secret Sharing

Sync secrets across your team using the cloud.

## Prerequisites

1. Create an account at [app.dotsetlabs.com](https://app.dotsetlabs.com)
2. Authenticate: `dotset login`

## Push Secrets to Cloud

```bash
dotset secrets sync --push
```

This uploads your encrypted secrets to the cloud. They remain encrypted — we never see your values.

## Pull Secrets from Cloud

```bash
dotset secrets sync --pull
```

Downloads secrets from the cloud and merges with your local store.

## Workflow

### Setting Up a New Team Member

1. Clone the repository
2. Initialize shield: `dotset init`
3. Get the project key from your team (securely!)
4. Login: `dotset login`
5. Pull secrets: `dotset secrets sync --pull`

<Warning>
Share your project key securely (e.g., 1Password, Vault). Never share it in Slack or email.
</Warning>

### Updating Secrets

```bash
# Add or update secret
dotset secrets set NEW_API_KEY "..."

# Push to team
dotset secrets sync --push
```

### Team Members Pull Updates

```bash
dotset secrets sync --pull
```

## Key Management

### Project Key

The `.dotset/key` file is shared across your team. Store it in:

- 1Password or LastPass
- HashiCorp Vault
- AWS Secrets Manager
- Your company's secret sharing system

### Never Commit the Key

Ensure `.dotset/key` is in your `.gitignore`:

```bash
echo ".dotset/key" >> .gitignore
```

## CI/CD Setup

For CI/CD, store the key as a repository secret:

```yaml
env:
  DOTSET_KEY: ${{ secrets.DOTSET_KEY }}
```

Then pull secrets in your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Setup secrets
  run: dotset secrets sync --pull
```

## Conflict Resolution

If both local and cloud have changes, pull downloads the cloud version. Your local changes are preserved as backups.
