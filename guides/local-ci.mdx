# Local CI Runner

Test your GitHub Actions workflows locally before pushing.

## Why Run Locally?

- **Faster feedback** — No waiting for cloud runners
- **Debug locally** — Full access to logs and state
- **Save minutes** — Test changes without using CI credits
- **Protected output** — Same secret redaction as cloud

## Quick Start

```bash
# List available jobs
dotset ci --list

# Run all jobs in first workflow
dotset ci

# Run specific jobs
dotset ci build test
```

## List Available Workflows

```bash
$ dotset ci --list

Available workflows:
  ci.yml
    → build: Build Application
    → test: Run Tests
    → lint: Lint Code
  release.yml  
    → publish: Publish to npm
```

## Run with Protection

```bash
dotset ci --mode redact
```

## Use Different Scopes

```bash
# Use staging secrets
dotset ci --scope staging

# Use production secrets (be careful!)
dotset ci --scope production
```

## Choose a Workflow File

```bash
dotset ci --file release.yml publish
```

## Example Output

```bash
$ dotset ci test
