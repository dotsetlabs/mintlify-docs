# GitHub Actions Integration

Shield integrates seamlessly with GitHub Actions to protect your CI builds.

## Basic Setup (Zero-Migration)

If your secrets are already in a `.env` file (e.g., created by a previous step), Shield works automatically:

```yaml
- name: Run tests with protection
  run: dotset run --mode redact -- npm test
```

## Using AWS Secrets Manager

Shield can pull secrets directly from AWS during your build. Ensure your runner has the correct IAM permissions:

```yaml
- name: Run with AWS Secrets
  run: dotset run --providers aws-sm --mode redact -- npm deploy
  env:
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    AWS_REGION: us-east-1
```

## Using Native Protected Storage

If you use Shield's native encrypted storage, provide your project key:

```yaml
- name: Run with native secrets
  run: dotset run --mode redact -- npm test
  env:
    DOTSET_KEY: ${{ secrets.DOTSET_KEY }}
```

<Tip>
To initialize a project for native storage, use `dotset secrets init` locally before pushing.
