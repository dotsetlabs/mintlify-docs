**Preflight** is a **free forever** infrastructure smoke-testing tool integrated into the Dotset CLI. While existing tools (like Zod or Envalid) check your **types**, Preflight checks your **connections**.

It runs "Active Probes" against your environment variables to verify that your databases, caches, and APIs are actually reachable and authenticated correctly.

## The Problem
Deployment failures often occur because:
*   `DATABASE_URL` has a typo in the hostname.
*   The production database is behind a firewall that hasn't been opened for your runner.
*   AWS credentials have expired.
*   A required environment variable is simply missing.

## The Solution
Preflight runs a suite of "Active Probes" pre-deployment. If a connection fails, Preflight exits with an error, preventing a broken build from reaching production.

```bash
# Validates presence AND tests connectivity
dotset preflight check
```

## Supported Probes

We support the most common infrastructure dependencies out of the box:
