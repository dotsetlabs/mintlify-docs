Managed Schemas allow team leads to define environment requirements in the Dotset Dashboard, ensuring all developers and services stay in sync with the latest infrastructure changes.

## Why Managed Schemas?

As teams grow, maintaining multiple `.preflight.yaml` files across microservices leads to drift. Managed Schemas move the "source of truth" to the Dotset Cloud.

- **Zero-Config Onboarding**: New developers just run `dotset preflight check` and get their requirements from the cloud.
- **Drift Protection**: If a new microservice is added to the architecture, the managed schema is updated once, and every developer is immediately notified of the new requirement.
- **Security Compliance**: Ensure every service in production has passed the required connectivity probes before deployment.

## Getting Started

### 1. Link your Project
First, link your local workspace to a Dotset project:

```bash
dotset link <project-id> --token <your-token>
```

### 2. Bootstrap from Cloud
When you run `preflight init` in a linked project, Preflight will automatically offer to pull the Managed Schema from your dashboard:

```bash
dotset preflight init
```

### 3. Cloud-First Validation
Once linked, `dotset preflight check` will prioritize the managed schema from the cloud over any local `.preflight.yaml`. This ensures that your local environment is always validated against the latest production-grade requirements.

## Health Analytics (Beta)

Every time you run `dotset preflight check` in a linked project, the results are reported back to your Dotset Dashboard. This provides a fleet-wide view of:
- **Environment Drift**: See who is missing required variables.
- **Infrastructure Health**: Track intermittent connectivity failures in CI or local development.
- **Onboarding Progress**: Monitor when new services are successfully integrated into developer environments.
