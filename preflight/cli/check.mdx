The `check` command is the heart of Preflight. It validates your current environment (usually `.env`) against the defined schema and runs all active infrastructure probes.

## Usage

```bash
dotset preflight check [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `-e, --env <name>` | Environment to validate (maps to `.env.<name>`) | `default` |
| `-s, --schema <path>` | Path to the schema file | `.preflight.yaml` |
| `--ci` | CI mode: exit with non-zero code on failure | - |
| `-q, --quiet` | Minimal output: only report errors | - |

## Automatic Remediation (MVP Feature)

When an active probe fails (e.g., Postgres connection refused), Preflight now provides **💡 Hints** to help you resolve the issue quickly.

### Common Hints
- **Postgres**: "Database service might not be running or is on a different port."
- **Redis**: "Authentication failed. Check your Redis password."
- **AWS**: "AWS Access Key ID is invalid."
- **HTTP**: "The endpoint URL might be incorrect."

## CI/CD Integration

Use the `--ci` flag in your pipelines to block deployments if environment variables are missing or if infrastructure is unreachable.

```yaml
- name: Preflight Check
  run: dotset preflight check --ci
```
