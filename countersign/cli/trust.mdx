When you trust an organization, all packages published by that organization receive a reputation bonus in the trust score calculation.

### Individual Trust

You can also trust individual maintainers:

countersign trust add user:johndoe
```

### Scope Trust

Trust all packages under a scope:

```bash
countersign trust add @mycompany
```
