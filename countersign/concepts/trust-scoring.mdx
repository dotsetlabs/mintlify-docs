# Trust Scoring

Countersign calculates a trust score (0-100) for every package based on multiple signals. This score helps you make informed decisions about what to install.

## Score Components

The trust score is composed of four weighted components:

| Component | Max Points | Weight |
| --------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Publisher Reputation | 40 | 40% |
| Signature Status | 25 | 25% |
| Provenance Data | 20 | 20% |
| Package Hygiene | 15 | 15% |

## Publisher Reputation (40 points)

Who published this package?

| Signal | Points |
| ------ | ------ |
| Verified organization | +35 |
| User-trusted publisher | +30 |
| 2FA enabled | +5 |
| Long-standing account (>1 year) | +3 |
| Multiple packages | +2 |
| Unknown/new publisher | 0 |

### Example

```
Publisher: anthropic (verified org)
  ├─ Verified organization    +35
  └─ 2FA enabled              +5
                              ───
                               40/40
```

## Signature Status (25 points)

Is there a valid cryptographic signature?

| Signal | Points |
| ------ | ------ |
| Valid SIGSTORE signature | +25 |
| Valid GPG signature | +20 |
| npm provenance attestation | +15 |
| Signature present but invalid | 0 |
| No signature | 0 |

### Example

```
Signature: SIGSTORE
  ├─ Signature valid          +25
  └─ Logged in Rekor          ✓
                              ───
                               25/25
```

## Provenance Data (20 points)

Can we trace the build to source code?

| Signal | Points |
| ------ | ------ |
| Full build provenance | +20 |
| Source repository linked | +10 |
| Build attestation only | +8 |
| Partial provenance | +5 |
| No provenance | 0 |

### Example

```
Provenance: Full
  ├─ GitHub Actions build     +10
  ├─ Source commit linked     +5
  └─ Build log available      +5
                              ───
                               20/20
```

## Package Hygiene (15 points)

Does the package follow security best practices?

| Signal | Points |
| ------ | ------ |
| No install scripts | +5 |
| Minimal dependencies (<5) | +5 |
| No network calls in postinstall | +3 |
| Clean dependency tree | +2 |
| Has install scripts | -5 |
| Excessive dependencies | -3 |

### Example

```
Hygiene: Good
  ├─ No install scripts       +5
  ├─ 2 dependencies           +5
  └─ No postinstall network   +3
                              ───
                               13/15
```

## Trust Levels

Scores map to human-readable trust levels:

| Score | Level | Color | Recommendation |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | -------------- |
| 80-100 | HIGH | 🟢 Green | Safe to install |
| 50-79 | MEDIUM | 🟡 Yellow | Review before installing |
| 20-49 | LOW | 🟠 Orange | Exercise caution |
| 0-19 | CRITICAL | 🔴 Red | Do not install |

## Viewing Score Breakdown

```bash
countersign verify --detailed @example/package
```

```
@example/package@1.0.0

Trust Score Breakdown:
  ├─ Publisher Reputation    35/40
  │    └─ Verified org: example
  ├─ Signature Status        25/25
  │    └─ SIGSTORE signature valid
  ├─ Provenance Data         15/20
  │    └─ Source linked, no build log
  └─ Package Hygiene         10/15
       └─ 3 dependencies, no scripts

Overall: 85/100 (HIGH) 🟢
```

## Customizing Thresholds

Set minimum score requirements:

```bash
# Require HIGH trust (80+)
countersign verify --min-score 80 @some/package

# Set in CI/CD
COUNTERSIGN_MIN_SCORE=70 countersign verify @some/package
```

## Trusted Publishers Override

Packages from trusted publishers get a reputation bonus:

```bash
# Add trusted publisher
countersign trust add anthropic

# Their packages now start with +35 reputation
```
