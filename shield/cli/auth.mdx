```

## dotset shield unlink

Disconnect the current project from cloud.

```bash
dotset shield unlink
```

This removes the `.dotset/project.json` configuration file.

---

## dotset shield status

Check the current cloud connection status.

```bash
dotset shield status
```

### Output

```bash
$ dotset shield status

✓ Linked to cloud
  Project ID: abc123
  API URL: https://api.dotsetlabs.com
```

## dotset shield sync

Fetch the latest security policies from the cloud.

```bash
dotset shield sync
```

Policies are cached locally and automatically used during `dotset shield run`.

---

## Cloud Features

After connecting, you get:

- **Protection Analytics** — View secret exposure stats in your dashboard
- **Centralized Policies** — Define regex patterns and blocklists in the dashboard
- **Team Collaboration** — Share projects with team members
- **Audit Logs** — Track all protection events

## Configuration Storage

Link configuration is stored in `.dotset/project.json` (project-local):

```json
{
  "projectId": "abc123",
  "apiToken": "dss_xxxx..."
}
```

> **Note**: Add `.dotset/` to your `.gitignore` to keep tokens out of version control.
