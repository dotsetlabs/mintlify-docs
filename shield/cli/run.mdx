# dotset shield run

Run any command with secrets injected from multiple providers and output protection.

## Usage

```bash
dotset shield run [options] -- <command...>
```

<Note>
Use `--` to separate dotset options from your command.
</Note>

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-p, --providers <list>` | Comma-separated providers | `auto` |
| `-s, --scope <scope>` | Environment scope | `development` |
| `-m, --mode <mode>` | Protection mode | `redact` |
| `--redact-text <text>` | Replacement text | `[REDACTED]` |
| `-q, --quiet` | Suppress shield output | `false` |
| `--report` | Generate HTML protection report | `false` |

## Secret Resolution

Shield aggregates secrets from configured providers. By default, it uses `auto` which attempts to detect all available sources.

### Supported Providers

- **dotenv**: Loads from `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development`, etc.
- **environment**: Shell environment variables (with common prefixes like `API_`, `SECRET_`, `TOKEN_`)
- **aws-sm**: AWS Secrets Manager

## Examples

### Zero-Setup (.env auto-detection)
```bash
dotset shield run -- npm start
```

### Explicit Providers
```bash
dotset shield run --providers dotenv,aws-sm -- node server.js
```

### With Redaction
```bash
dotset shield run --mode redact -- npm test
```

### Production Scope
```bash
dotset shield run --scope production -- node server.js
```

## Compliance Reports

Use the `--report` flag to generate a standalone HTML report after each run. This is useful for:

- **Audit trails**: Document what protection was applied
- **Compliance evidence**: SOC 2, ISO 27001 artifact generation
- **CI artifacts**: Upload to your build system for review

```bash
dotset shield run --report -- npm test
# Generates: shield-report.html
```

The report includes:
- Run summary (command, mode, duration)
- Secrets protected (count by provider)
- Exposures detected and blocked
- Pattern matches with severity levels

<Tip>
In CI, upload the report as a build artifact for compliance auditing.

## Security Policies

Shield uses a curated set of high-accuracy patterns (AWS keys, GitHub tokens, OpenAI keys, etc.) to scan your output.

See the [Security Policies](/shield/concepts/security-policies) guide for a full list of supported patterns.

## How It Works

1. **Resolution**: Aggregates secrets from all specified providers.
2. **Injection**: Injects discovered secrets into the child process environment.
3. **Sanitization**: Intercepts `stdout`/`stderr` using a **streaming line-buffered engine**. This ensures secrets are caught even if split across output chunks.
4. **Dynamic Detection**: Scans for assignment patterns (e.g. `password=`) and high-entropy strings, providing a safety net for secrets not covered by standard regex.
5. **Flush**: Flushes any remaining buffered text before exiting.

## Exit Codes

The exit code matches your command's exit code. Shield itself never fails silently.
