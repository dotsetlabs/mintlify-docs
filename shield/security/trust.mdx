# Trust & Transparency

We understand that feeding your secrets through any tool requires trust. This page explains exactly what Shield does with your data.

## Your Secrets Never Leave Your Machine

<Warning>
**TL;DR**: Secret values are processed entirely locally. Shield never transmits your actual secrets anywhere.
</Warning>

Here's exactly what happens when you run `dotset shield run`:

    A[Your Secrets] --> B[Shield CLI]
    B --> C[In-Memory Only]
    C --> D[Redaction Engine]
    D --> E[Protected Output]
    
    style A fill:#fef3c7
```

1. **Secrets are read** from your providers (`.env`, AWS SM, environment variables)
2. **Values are held in-memory** during command execution only
3. **Output streams are scanned** for these values and redacted
4. **After exit**, secret values are garbage collected — never written to disk

### What is NOT Collected

| Data | Collected? | Reason |
|------|---------|--------|
| Secret values | ❌ Never | Processed locally only |
| Secret names/keys | ❌ Never | Not needed |
| Build log contents | ❌ Never | Redaction happens locally |
| Source code | ❌ Never | We never access your code |
| `.env` file contents | ❌ Never | Read locally, never transmitted |

## 100% Local Operation

Shield is designed to work **100% locally**. No cloud connection is required:

| Feature | Works Offline? |

### 1. Read the Code

The entire CLI is open source. Check any file you want:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dotsetlabs/cli
# Read any file — there's nothing hidden
```

### 2. Build From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dotsetlabs/cli
cd shield
