# Getting Started with Deadfall

Deadfall plants tripwires in your project — files that look like valuable credentials but are actually traps. When an AI agent or attacker accesses them, you get alerted.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/dotsetlabs/deadfall/cmd/deadfall@latest
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Your Project

```bash
deadfall init
```

This creates:
- A `.deadfall/` directory with configuration and registry
- A `.env.production` canary file with fake AWS credentials

### 2. Generate Additional Canaries

```bash
# Fake MCP config (attracts AI agents)
deadfall generate mcp

# Fake SSH key
deadfall generate ssh

# Fake AWS credentials
deadfall generate aws

# Fake Cursor rules with "secrets"
deadfall generate cursor-rules
```

### 3. Start Monitoring

```bash
deadfall watch
```

When any canary is accessed, you'll see:

```
[TRIGGER] 2026-01-05 14:32:15
  Canary: .env.production
  Type: env
  Access: READ
  Process: cursor (PID 12345)
  User: developer
```

### 4. Add Webhook Alerts (Optional)

```bash
deadfall watch --webhook https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX
```

## What to Deploy

For a typical project, consider:

```bash
# Must-have: catches credential-seeking agents
deadfall generate env .env.production

# AI-specific: catches AI assistants exploring configs
deadfall generate claude-md
deadfall generate cursor-rules

# High-value targets
deadfall generate ssh secrets/id_rsa_backup
deadfall generate aws secrets/aws-credentials
```

## Best Practices

1. **Add `.deadfall/` to `.gitignore`** — The registry tracks canary metadata
2. **Use realistic paths** — `secrets/`, `.env.production`, etc.
3. **Don't overdo it** — A few well-placed canaries are more effective than many
4. **Monitor the watch output** — Or set up webhook alerts

## Next Steps

- [Generate command reference](/deadfall/cli/generate) — All canary types
- [Watch command reference](/deadfall/cli/watch) — Monitoring options
- [Alert configuration](/deadfall/concepts/alerting) — Webhook setup
