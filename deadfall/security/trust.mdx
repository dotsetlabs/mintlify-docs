# Trust & Security

Deadfall is designed with privacy and security as core principles.

## Security Guarantees

### Local Processing

- **Runs entirely locally** — No cloud dependencies
- **No telemetry** — Usage data never leaves your machine
- **No account required** — No signup, no tracking
- **Works offline** — No internet required for core features

### Open Source

Deadfall is fully open source under the MIT license:

```bash
# Clone and audit
git clone https://github.com/dotsetlabs/deadfall
cd deadfall
```

All code is auditable. No obfuscation, no analytics, no phone-home.

## What Deadfall Stores

### Configuration File (deadfall.json)

```json
{
  "traps": [
    {
      "path": ".cursorrules",
      "token": "abc123...",
      "type": "cursor-rules",
      "created_at": "2026-01-05T14:32:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

This file tracks:
- File paths with traps
- Unique tokens for correlation
- Trap types and creation times

### Alert Log (deadfall_alerts.log)

Plain-text log file with timestamps and alert details:

```
2026-01-05T14:32:15-05:00 [critical] [Trap Triggered]: AI agent read trapped file | file=.cursorrules
```

## Threat Model

### What Deadfall Protects Against

| Threat | How |
|:-------|:----|
| AI agent compromise | Cognitive honeypots detect instruction following |
| Credential-seeking agents | Honeypot tools attract and alert on access attempts |
| Unknown threats | AI-specific traps are read automatically by assistants |

### What Deadfall Does NOT Protect Against

| Threat | Why | Mitigation |
|:-------|:----|:-----------|
| Real-time blocking | Deadfall detects, doesn't prevent | Use [Tollgate](https://github.com/dotsetlabs/tollgate) |
| Non-AI threats | Relies on instruction-following behavior | Use traditional honeypots |
| Disabled MCP server | Traps require the server running | Keep server running |

## Trust Boundaries

### Trusted

1. **Deadfall binary** — Built from open source
2. **Local filesystem** — OS-level security
3. **MCP client** — Configured by user

### Untrusted

1. **AI agents** — May be compromised
2. **Network** — Webhook delivery should use HTTPS

## Best Practices

### File Permissions

```bash
# Restrict config file
chmod 600 deadfall.json

# Restrict log file  
chmod 600 deadfall_alerts.log
```

### Git Ignore

Always add to `.gitignore`:

```
deadfall.json
deadfall_alerts.log
```

### Webhook Security

If using webhook alerts, always use HTTPS URLs and keep webhook URLs secret.

## Reporting Security Issues
