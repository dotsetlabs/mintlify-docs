# Alerting

When a trap is triggered or a honeypot tool is called, Deadfall sends alerts through multiple channels.

## Alert Channels

### 1. Console Logging

Structured logs are written to the terminal when running `deadfall serve`:

```
ERROR Security Alert severity=critical title="Trap Triggered" file=.cursorrules trap_type=cursor-rules token=abc123...
```

### 2. File Logging

All alerts are written to `deadfall_alerts.log`:

```
2026-01-05T14:32:15-05:00 [critical] [Trap Triggered]: AI agent read trapped file and followed instruction | file=.cursorrules | trap_type=cursor-rules | token=abc123...
```

**Log rotation:** When the log exceeds 10MB, it's rotated to `deadfall_alerts.log.bak`.

### 3. Desktop Notifications

Cross-platform desktop notifications via system tray:

```
🚨 Deadfall: Trap Triggered
AI agent read trapped file and followed instruction
```

**Supported platforms:**
- macOS (native notifications)
- Linux (libnotify)
- Windows (toast notifications)

### 4. Webhook Delivery

Send alerts to external services (Slack, Discord, custom endpoints):

```go
// Configure programmatically
alerter.SetWebhookURL("https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX")
```

**Webhook payload:**

```json
{
  "event": "deadfall_alert",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-05T14:32:15Z",
  "severity": "critical",
  "title": "Trap Triggered",
  "message": "AI agent read trapped file and followed instruction",
  "hostname": "developer-macbook",
  "context": {
    "token": "abc123def456...",
    "file": ".cursorrules",
    "trap_type": "cursor-rules",
    "created_at": "2026-01-05T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Retry logic:** Failed webhook deliveries are retried 3 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s).

## Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Example |
|:---------|:------------|:--------|
| `critical` | High-confidence compromise detection | Trap triggered, secret access attempt |
| `warning` | Suspicious activity | Unknown token, private file access |
| `info` | Informational | Normal system events |

## Rate Limiting

To prevent alert spam, Deadfall enforces a minimum interval between alerts (100ms). During rapid-fire triggers, some alerts may be suppressed.

## Alert Context

Trap-triggered alerts include rich context for investigation:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `token` | Unique trap identifier |
| `file` | Path to the file that was read |
| `trap_type` | Type of trap (cursor-rules, claude-context, etc.) |
| `created_at` | When the trap was deployed |

## Viewing Alert History

Check the log file for alert history:

```bash
cat deadfall_alerts.log

# Or tail for real-time monitoring
tail -f deadfall_alerts.log
```
