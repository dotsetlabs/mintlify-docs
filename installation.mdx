# Installation

## npm (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @dotsetlabs/shield
```

## Yarn

```bash
yarn global add @dotsetlabs/shield
```

## pnpm

```bash
pnpm add -g @dotsetlabs/shield
```

## Verify Installation

```bash
dotset --version
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or later
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

## Project Setup

Shield is designed for zero-migration. If you use `.env` files, you can start using it immediately:

```bash
cd your-project
dotset run -- npm start
```

If you want to use Shield's native encrypted storage (required for cloud sync), initialize your project:

```bash
dotset secrets init
```

<Tip>
When using native storage, add `.dotset/key` to your `.gitignore` immediately. This file contains your encryption key and should never be committed.
</Tip>


## Updating

```bash
npm update -g @dotsetlabs/shield
```

## Uninstalling

```bash
npm uninstall -g @dotsetlabs/shield
```
