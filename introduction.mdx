# dotset shield

**Real-time secret protection for CI/CD build logs.**

Secrets leak in build logs every day. Debug statements, error messages, and verbose logging expose API keys, tokens, and credentials. GitHub's built-in masking can't catch everything. GitGuardian scans *after* the breach.

**dotset shield** intercepts output streams and redacts secrets in real-time — before they're ever exposed.

## The Problem

```bash
# This happens more than you think
console.log("Connecting with", process.env.DATABASE_URL);
# Output: Connecting with postgres://admin:super_secret_password@db.example.com/prod
```

Your CI logs are public to your team. Sometimes they're public to everyone. One accidental `console.log` and your credentials are compromised.

## The Solution

```bash
# Run any command with shield protection
dotset run --mode redact -- npm start

# Output: Connecting with [REDACTED]
```

Shield wraps your commands, injects secrets into the environment, and redacts them from all output streams.
