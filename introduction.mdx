# Dotset Shield

**Log sanitization for CI/CD.**

Secrets leak in build logs every day. Debug statements, error messages, and verbose logging expose API keys, tokens, and credentials.

**Dotset Shield** intercepts output streams and redacts secrets in real-time — with **zero migration** and **dynamic secret detection**.

```bash
dotset shield run -- npm start
```

> [!NOTE]
> Shield processes secrets locally and never sends values to the cloud. [Learn more →](/shield/security/trust)
