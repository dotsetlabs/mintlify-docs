**Security tools for the AI era.**

Dotset Labs provides security tools for developers working with AI assistants:

- **[Tollgate](/tollgate/cli/overview)** - Policy-based access control for AI agents using MCP
- **[Hardpoint](/hardpoint/cli/overview)** - Developer environment security scanner for the AI era

---

## Tollgate

AI agents using MCP servers have full access to powerful tools — databases, filesystems, and APIs. Without access control, a single prompt injection or misunderstood request can cause damage.

**Tollgate** adds policy-based access control to any MCP server, letting you allow, deny, or prompt for approval on each tool call. Identify risks early with automated server scanning and 50+ pre-built policy templates.

```bash
npm install -g @dotsetlabs/tollgate
tollgate wrap npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres
```

> [!NOTE]
> Tollgate runs entirely locally with no cloud dependencies. [Learn more →](/tollgate/security/trust)

## Hardpoint

AI coding assistants introduce new attack surfaces. Malicious `.cursorrules` files, prompt injection in `CLAUDE.md`, hidden Unicode characters, and backdoors in shell configs can compromise your development environment.

**Hardpoint** scans your environment for these AI-era threats — detecting issues that traditional security tools miss.

```bash
go install github.com/dotsetlabs/hardpoint/cmd/hardpoint@latest
hardpoint scan
```

> [!NOTE]
> Hardpoint runs entirely locally with no network access. [Learn more →](/hardpoint/security/trust)

## Quick Install

```bash
# For MCP access control
npm install -g @dotsetlabs/tollgate

# For dev environment security
go install github.com/dotsetlabs/hardpoint/cmd/hardpoint@latest
```
