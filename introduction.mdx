# Dotset Labs

**Security tools for the AI era.**

Dotset Labs provides security tools for developers working with AI coding assistants:

- **[Hardpoint](/hardpoint/overview)** - Static security scanner for Rules File Backdoor attacks
- **[Overwatch](/overwatch/overview)** - Runtime security proxy for MCP servers

---

## Hardpoint

AI coding assistants read instructions from configuration files like `.cursorrules`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `mcp.json`. Attackers can exploit this with the **Rules File Backdoor** attack - hiding malicious instructions in comments, encoded content, or structural elements that are invisible to developers but executed by AI.

**Hardpoint** scans your environment for these AI-era threats with 9 detection rules focused on semantic hijacking, command injection, and git security.

```bash
go install github.com/dotsetlabs/hardpoint/cmd/hardpoint@latest
hardpoint scan
```

**Key Features:**
- Semantic hijacking detection with 80+ obfuscation-resistant patterns (AI-008)
- MCP command injection detection in mcp.json configurations (AI-005)
- Encoded instruction detection for hidden Base64 payloads (AI-004)
- Git hook security scanning (GIT-001 through GIT-006)
- Trust/verify system with HMAC-SHA256 integrity checking
- CI integration with SARIF output for GitHub Code Scanning

> Hardpoint runs entirely locally with no network access.

## Overwatch

AI agents using MCP servers have access to powerful tools - databases, filesystems, and APIs. Without access control, a single prompt injection or malicious MCP server can cause serious damage. **Tool Shadowing** (CVE-2025-6514) allows malicious servers to impersonate trusted tools.

**Overwatch** is a security proxy that intercepts MCP tool calls, detects tool shadowing attacks, and enforces policies before execution.

```bash
npm install -g @dotsetlabs/overwatch
overwatch wrap npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres
```

**Key Features:**
- Tool shadowing detection with schema hashing and mutation monitoring
- Declarative policy engine with allow/prompt/deny actions
- Session-based approval grants with revocation
- Comprehensive audit logging with JSON/CSV/CEF export
- Circuit breaker and timeout protection for reliability

> Overwatch runs entirely locally with no cloud dependencies.
