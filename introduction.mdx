# dotset shield

**The unified secret protection engine for CI/CD build logs.**

Secrets leak in build logs every day. Debug statements, error messages, and verbose logging expose API keys, tokens, and credentials. GitHub's built-in masking can't catch everything. GitGuardian scans *after* the breach.

**dotset shield** intercepts output streams and redacts secrets in real-time — with **zero migration** and **multi-provider support**.

## Zero Migration

Shield works with your existing workflow. If you use `.env` files, you can start protecting your logs instantly without moving a single secret.

```bash
# Shield auto-detects .env files and starts protecting
dotset run -- npm start
```

## Provider-Agnostic

Stop worrying about where your secrets live. Shield aggregates secrets from multiple sources into a single protected environment:

- **Ecosystem**: `.env`, `.env.local`, etc.
- **Infrastructure**: AWS Secrets Manager
- **Environment**: Shell environment variables
- **Dotset**: Native encrypted, cloud-synced storage
