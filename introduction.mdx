# Dotset CLI

**Security tools for CI/CD and AI agents.**

The Dotset CLI provides two security tools:

- **[Mantle](/mantle/cli/overview)** - Secret detection and log sanitization for CI/CD pipelines
- **[Tollgate](/tollgate/cli/overview)** - Policy-based access control for AI agents using MCP

---

## Mantle

Secrets leak in build logs every day. Debug statements, error messages, and verbose logging expose API keys, tokens, and credentials.

**Dotset Mantle** intercepts output streams and redacts secrets in real-time — with **zero migration** and **dynamic secret detection**.

```bash
dotset mantle run -- npm start
```

> [!NOTE]
> Mantle processes secrets locally and never sends values to the cloud. [Learn more →](/mantle/security/trust)

---

## Tollgate

AI agents using MCP servers have full access to powerful tools — databases, filesystems, and APIs. Without access control, a single prompt injection or misunderstood request can cause damage.

**Dotset Tollgate** adds policy-based access control to any MCP server, letting you allow, deny, or prompt for approval on each tool call.

```bash
dotset tollgate wrap npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres
```

> [!NOTE]
> Tollgate runs entirely locally with no cloud dependencies. [Learn more →](/tollgate/security/trust)

## Quick Install

```bash
npm install -g @dotsetlabs/cli
```
