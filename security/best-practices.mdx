# Security Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to maximize your security.

## Key Management

<Warning>
Your `.dotset/key` file is the only way to decrypt your secrets. Treat it like a password.
</Warning>

### Do

- ✓ Store the key in a password manager (1Password, Vault)
- ✓ Add `.dotset/key` to `.gitignore`
- ✓ Use different keys for different environments
- ✓ Store CI keys as repository secrets

### Don't

- ✗ Commit the key to version control
- ✗ Share the key via Slack, email, or plaintext
- ✗ Use the same key across all projects
- ✗ Store the key in environment variables on shared systems

## Secret Hygiene

### Use Scopes

```bash
# Keep production separate
dotset secrets set API_KEY "dev-key" --scope development
dotset secrets set API_KEY "prod-key" --scope production
```

### Rotate Regularly

```bash
# Update a secret
dotset secrets set API_KEY "new-key"

# Push to team
dotset secrets sync --push
```

### Delete Unused Secrets

```bash
dotset secrets delete OLD_KEY
```

## CI/CD Security

### Use Redact Mode

```bash
dotset run --mode redact -- npm test
```

### Use Quiet Mode in CI

```bash
dotset run --mode redact --quiet -- npm test
```

### Store Keys Securely

```yaml
env:
  DOTSET_KEY: ${{ secrets.DOTSET_KEY }}
```

## Audit Your Logs

### Check for Exposures

```bash
# Run with detect mode to audit
dotset run --mode detect -- npm start
```

### Review CI Logs

After enabling shield, review your existing CI logs for any historical exposure.

## Defense in Depth

Shield is one layer of protection. Also consider:

| Layer | Tool |
|-------|------|
| Secrets in code | GitLeaks, TruffleHog |
| Runtime protection | dotset shield |
| Log monitoring | GitGuardian, Datadog |
| Access control | IAM, RBAC |

## Incident Response

If you suspect a secret leak:

1. **Rotate immediately** — Generate new credentials
2. **Revoke old secrets** — Invalidate compromised tokens
3. **Audit access** — Check logs for unauthorized use
4. **Update shield** — Ensure the new secret is protected
