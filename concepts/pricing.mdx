## FAQ

### Is the CLI free?

Yes. The CLI is open source and free forever. Paid plans add cloud features like analytics, team collaboration, and extended retention.

### What counts as a run?

Each execution of `dotset run` counts as one run. Free users get 100 runs/month, which is plenty for most hobby projects.

### What are custom detection patterns?

Business users can create custom regex patterns via the dashboard to detect proprietary secrets specific to their organization.

### Can I self-host?

Enterprise customers can self-host the platform. Contact us for details.

### How is pricing calculated?

Flat per-month pricing, not per-seat. A team of 10 on Business pays $39/month total.
