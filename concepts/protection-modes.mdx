# Protection Modes

Shield offers three protection modes for different use cases.

## Detect Mode

**Logs when secrets appear in output but doesn't modify anything.**

```bash
dotset run --mode detect -- npm test
```

Best for:
- Auditing existing builds
- Understanding what would be caught
- Development without surprises

Output:
```
⚠️  Secret exposure detected: API_KEY
⚠️  Secret exposure detected: DATABASE_URL
```

## Redact Mode (Recommended)

**Replaces secrets with `[REDACTED]` in real-time.**

```bash
dotset run --mode redact -- npm test
```

Best for:
- Production CI/CD pipelines
- Log storage systems
- Team debugging sessions

Output:
```
Connecting to [REDACTED]
Using API key: [REDACTED]
```

<Tip>
Redact mode is the recommended default for most teams. It prevents exposure while keeping logs readable.
</Tip>

## Block Mode

**Completely suppresses any output line containing a secret.**

```bash
dotset run --mode block -- npm test
```

Best for:
- Highly sensitive environments
- Compliance requirements
- Zero-tolerance policies

Output:
```
Starting server...
[blocked: contained secret]
Server ready
```

## Comparison

| Mode | Output | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| `detect` | Unchanged | Auditing |
| `redact` | `[REDACTED]` | Daily use |
| `block` | Line removed | High security |

## Setting Default Mode

You can set the default mode in your project configuration:

```json
// .dotset/config.json
{
  "mode": "redact"
}
```
