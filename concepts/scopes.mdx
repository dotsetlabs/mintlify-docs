# Environment Scopes

Shield supports scopes for managing secrets across different environments. This is primarily useful when working with different `.env` files.

## Available Scopes

| Scope | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `development` | Local development (default) | Dev API keys |
| `staging` | Staging/preview environments | Staging database |
| `production` | Production environment | Live credentials |

## How Scopes Work with Providers

### Dotenv Provider

The dotenv provider automatically loads scope-specific files:

```bash
# development scope (default)
.env                    # Always loaded
.env.local              # Always loaded (overrides .env)
.env.development        # Loaded for development scope
.env.development.local  # Loaded for development scope

# production scope
.env                    # Always loaded
.env.local              # Always loaded
.env.production         # Loaded for production scope
.env.production.local   # Loaded for production scope
```

### Running with a Scope

```bash
# Uses development secrets (default)
dotset run -- npm start

# Uses staging secrets
dotset run --scope staging -- npm start

# Uses production secrets  
dotset run --scope production -- npm start
```

## Use Cases

### Local Development
```bash
# .env.development contains local dev values
dotset run -- npm start
```

### CI/CD Staging
```bash
dotset run --scope staging -- npm test
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
dotset run --scope production -- node server.js
```

<Tip>
In production CI/CD, you typically don't need scopes since your CI platform injects the correct secrets as environment variables. Scopes are most useful for local development with `.env` files.
