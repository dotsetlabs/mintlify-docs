# Tachyon Guides

Practical guides for using Tachyon in development and CI/CD.

## Webhook Testing

Test webhooks from Stripe, GitHub, and other services locally.

### 1. Create a tunnel

```bash
tcn share 3000
# → https://abc123.tunnel.dotsetlabs.com
```

### 2. Configure endpoint

Copy the tunnel URL to your provider: `https://abc123.tunnel.dotsetlabs.com/api/webhooks/stripe`

### 3. Inspect requests

Tachyon captures incoming requests. Open the [Inspector](/tachyon/inspector) to see payloads.

---

## Team Demos & Sharing

Share your local environment with teammates.

### 1. Create an authenticated tunnel

```bash
tcn share 3000 --subdomain my-feature
```

By default, only your team members can access this URL.

### 2. Make it public (if needed)

```bash
tcn share 3000 --public
```

---

## CI Preview Environments

Create preview environments for pull requests.

### 1. Authenticate in CI

Use the `TACHYON_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable in your CI provider.

### 2. Create preview tunnel

```yaml
- name: Start app & create tunnel
  run: |
    npm start &
    sleep 5
    tcn share 3000 --subdomain pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
```

### 3. Post to GitHub

Use a script to post the URL `https://pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.tunnel.dotsetlabs.com` back to the PR as a comment.
