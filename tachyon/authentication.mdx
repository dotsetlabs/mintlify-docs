# Authentication

Tachyon provides flexible access control for your tunnels.

## Default: Team Authentication

By default, tunnels require sign-in with company credentials:

```bash
tcn share 3000
```

Users must authenticate via GitHub/Google before accessing.

## Public Access

Disable authentication for demos or webhooks:

```bash
tcn share 3000 --public
```

<Warning>
Public tunnels are accessible by anyone with the URL. Use carefully.
</Warning>

## Email Allowlist

Restrict access to specific email addresses:

```bash
tcn share 3000 --allow alice@company.com bob@company.com
```

Only users with matching email addresses can access.

## Reserved Subdomains

With a Pro plan, reserve a consistent subdomain:

```bash
tcn share 3000 --subdomain my-api
# → https://my-api.tunnel.dotsetlabs.dev
```

Benefits:
- Consistent URL across sessions
- Easy to remember and share
- Webhook configurations don't break

## Project-Level Access

Grant access to entire teams via projects:

```bash
# Create project
tcn share 3000 --new-project "API Development"

# Add team members
tcn members add alice@company.com
tcn members add bob@company.com
```

All project members can access tunnels in that project.

## Access Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access, can delete project |
| **Admin** | Manage members, create tunnels |
| **Member** | Access tunnels, view requests |
| **Viewer** | View tunnels only |

## SSO Providers

Tachyon supports:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="GitHub" icon="github">
    Default SSO provider. Personal or organization accounts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Google" icon="google">
    Use `tcn login --google` to authenticate.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use authentication** — Only use `--public` when necessary
2. **Limit access** — Use `--allow` to restrict to specific emails
3. **Use projects** — Organize tunnels by team or purpose
4. **Monitor access** — Check tunnel access in the dashboard
