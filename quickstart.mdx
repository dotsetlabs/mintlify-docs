# Quickstart

Get the full security stack running in under a minute.

## 1. Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g @dotsetlabs/cli
```

## 2. Initialize Your Project

```bash
cd your-project
dotset init
```

This creates a `.dotset/` directory with your project configuration. All modules (Secrets, Security, Local CI, and Crash Replay) are enabled by default and ready to use.

## 3. Add Your First Secret

```bash
dotset secrets set DATABASE_URL "postgres://localhost/mydb"
dotset secrets set API_KEY "sk-your-api-key"
```

Secrets are encrypted locally with AES-256-GCM. They never touch disk unencrypted.

## 4. Run Your App

```bash
dotset run -- npm start
```

This command:
1. Injects your secrets into `process.env`
2. Monitors stdout/stderr for leaked secrets
3. Tracks outbound network connections

## 5. Replay a Production Crash (Optional)

```bash
dotset replay evt_abc123
```

This replays a production request context locally to help you reproduce and fix bugs in seconds.

## 6. Add Team Members

Invite colleagues to your project with role-based access:

```bash
dotset team add coworker@example.com --role member --scopes development
```

This gives them access to your project secrets and audit logs within the specified scope.

## Gitignore

Add this to your `.gitignore`:

```
.dotset/
```

The `.dotset/` directory contains your encrypted secrets and local configuration. Don't commit it to version control.
