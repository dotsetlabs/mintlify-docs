# Overwatch CLI

Overwatch is the AI Shell Guardian - it protects your terminal from dangerous AI-suggested commands by intercepting and validating them before execution.

## Installation

Overwatch is included with the `@dotsetlabs/tollgate` package:

```bash
npm install -g @dotsetlabs/tollgate
```

This installs both the `tollgate` and `overwatch` binaries.

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize shell hooks:**
   ```bash
   overwatch init
   ```

2. **Restart your shell** or run:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc for Zsh
   ```

3. **Test it works:**
   ```bash
   overwatch analyze "rm -rf /"
   ```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `overwatch check <command>` | Analyze and approve a shell command |
| `overwatch analyze <command>` | Analyze command risk without prompting |
| `overwatch init` | Set up shell hooks for command interception |
| `overwatch hook <shell>` | Output hook script for shell integration |
| `overwatch sessions` | List active session grants |
| `overwatch revoke [id]` | Revoke a session grant |
| `overwatch log` | View audit log |
| `overwatch config` | Show current configuration |

## How It Works

When you run a command in your terminal:

1. **Interception** - Overwatch intercepts the command before execution
2. **Analysis** - The command is analyzed for risk level (safe, read, write, destructive, dangerous)
3. **Decision** - Based on your policy, the command is allowed, denied, or requires approval
4. **Execution** - If approved, the command runs normally

## Configuration

Overwatch uses the `overwatch` section of your `tollgate.yaml` configuration:

```yaml
overwatch:
  enabled: true
  risks:
    safe: allow
    read: allow
    write: prompt
    destructive: prompt
    dangerous: deny
  session:
    allowRemember: true
    defaultScope: tool
    allowedDurations:
      - once
      - 5min
      - 15min
      - session
```

## Integration with Claude Code and Cursor

Overwatch works automatically with AI coding assistants that run terminal commands:

- **Claude Code** - Commands suggested by Claude are validated before execution
- **Cursor** - Terminal commands from Cursor are intercepted and checked
- **Any AI terminal** - Works with any tool that runs shell commands
