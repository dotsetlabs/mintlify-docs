# Getting Started with Overwatch

Overwatch protects your terminal from dangerous AI-suggested commands. This guide will have you up and running in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later
- A supported shell: Bash, Zsh, or Fish

## Installation

Install Overwatch via npm:

```bash
npm install -g @dotsetlabs/tollgate
```

This installs both the `tollgate` and `overwatch` binaries globally.

<Note>
If you're using the unified Dotset CLI, Overwatch commands are available as `dotset overwatch`.
</Note>

## Initialize Shell Hooks

Run the init command to set up shell integration:

```bash
overwatch init
```

This will:
1. Detect your current shell (Bash, Zsh, or Fish)
2. Add the Overwatch hook to your shell configuration
3. Provide next steps

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc
eval "$(overwatch hook bash)"
```

```zsh Zsh
# Add to ~/.zshrc
eval "$(overwatch hook zsh)"
```

```fish Fish
# Add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish
overwatch hook fish | source
```
</CodeGroup>

## Restart Your Shell

After initialization, restart your shell or source your config:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc for Zsh
```

## Test the Installation

Try analyzing a dangerous command:

```bash
overwatch analyze "rm -rf /"
```

You should see output like:

```
Command Analysis
--------------------------------------------------

  Command:  rm -rf /
  Risk:     dangerous
  Reason:   Attempts to delete root filesystem
  Triggers: rm, -rf, /

With current configuration:
  Action:   deny
```

## Test Command Interception

Now try running a risky command:

```bash
rm -rf important_folder
```

Overwatch will intercept and prompt:

```
Command: rm -rf important_folder
Risk:    destructive
Reason:  Recursive force delete

[y] Allow once
[n] Deny
[5] Allow for 5 minutes
[s] Allow for session
>
```

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Analyze a command without running it
overwatch analyze "your command here"

# View active sessions
overwatch sessions

# Revoke all session grants
overwatch revoke --all

# View recent audit log
overwatch log

# View configuration
overwatch config

# Disable temporarily
overwatch-disable

# Re-enable
overwatch-enable

# Check status
overwatch-status
```

## Configuration

Overwatch uses the `overwatch` section of `tollgate.yaml`:

```yaml
# tollgate.yaml
overwatch:
  enabled: true
  risks:
    safe: allow
    read: allow
    write: prompt
    destructive: prompt
    dangerous: deny
```

## What's Protected?

Overwatch analyzes commands for:

- **Filesystem operations** - Dangerous rm, chmod, chown patterns
- **Network operations** - Reverse shells, curl piped to bash
- **Privilege escalation** - sudo, su patterns
- **Destructive patterns** - Fork bombs, disk wiping
- **Data exfiltration** - Sending secrets to external hosts
