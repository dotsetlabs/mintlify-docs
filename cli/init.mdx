# dotset secrets init

Initialize a new encrypted secrets store in the current directory. This is only necessary if you want to use Shield's native encrypted storage. If you only use `.env` files or AWS Secrets Manager, you can skip this step.


## Usage

```bash
dotset secrets init
```

## What It Does

1. Creates `.dotset/` directory
2. Generates a random encryption key (`.dotset/key`)
3. Creates an encrypted manifest (`.dotset/manifest.enc`)
4. Adds `.dotset/key` to `.gitignore`

## Output

```bash
$ dotset secrets init

✓ Created .dotset/key
✓ Created .dotset/manifest.enc
✓ Added .dotset/key to .gitignore

Shield native storage initialized.
```

<Warning>
**Never commit your `.dotset/key` file.** If you lose this key, your encrypted secrets cannot be recovered.
</Warning>

## Why use Native Storage?

While Shield supports `.env` and AWS, native storage provides:
1. **Cloud Sync**: Securely sync secrets across team members.
2. **Local Encryption**: Secrets are always encrypted at rest on your machine.
3. **Deterministic Deployments**: Committing the encrypted manifest ensures your CI always has the correct secret versions.
